                            <p class="detail">Scully and colleagues report 23 cases of abnormal clotting, primarily involving the cerebral veins, 6 to 24 days after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The syndrome was incited by antibodies to platelet factor 4, independent of heparin therapy. Early recognition and avoidance of platelet transfusion are key.</p>

                            <p class="detail">The rare vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia that may follow adenovirus-based Covid-19 vaccination resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, but rapid assays for anti-PF4 antibodies used to diagnose HIT may be negative in patients with VITT. The PF4–serotonin release assay appears to detect the IgG antibodies to PF4–PVS that mediate this condition.</p>

                            <p class="detail">This randomized trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine involved 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. Similar levels of antibody to SARS-CoV-2 were elicited in the 12-to-15-year-old participants and in 16-to-25-year-old participants in a parallel trial. Among participants with no evidence of previous infection, no cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in vaccine recipients, as compared with 16 cases in placebo recipients.</p>
